Version 1.2
- Library names have been moved into the `squids` namespace
- Support for extraction of SU vectors and basis transformations to GSL matrices
- Implementation of matrix exponentiation for use cases like evolution with non-diagonalized Hamiltonians
- Implementation of a number of useful matrix operations on SU vectors, including applying arbitrary unitary transformations, extracting real and imaginary components, transposition, and generalized, weighted rotations
- Support for obtaining the eigensystem which diagonalizes an SU_vector
- Explicit disallowance of creating or manipulating SU(1) vectors, which are degenerate with scalars
- A fix to a severe issue in the use of the GSL ODE interface, now giving good output for much less stringent tolerance values
- Optimization of element-wise operations on SU vectors without the need to allocate temporary storage
- Redesign of SU vector operations for vectorizability, including optimized allocation of element storage with optimal alignment
- Implementation of a more efficient version of SU vector time evolution which can share initialization costs across multiple evolutions by the same operator over the same time interval
- A more precise definition of the meter
- Improvements to configuration and build system
- Clean up of capitalization for file and class names
- Rearrangement of project files to a more standard layout
- Elimination of memory leaks
- Limited support for the Intel and Portland Group compilers. These should not be considered guaranteed to work, but have been given minimal testing and appear compile the library correctly. 
- Added additional unit converstions to SQuIDS constants
